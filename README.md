Audio Enhancement Tool (WIP)
Overview

This project is developing a deep learning-based tool to enhance audio quality by restoring lost high frequencies and improving bitrates and sample rates of audio files. It's particularly aimed at enhancing older recordings, like those from vinyl records, to match modern audio quality standards without altering the original essence.
