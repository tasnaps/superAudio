Audio Enhancement Tool (WIP)
Overview

Trial of using U-net to try to restore high and low frequencies of music tracks. The outcome was something truly horrible and I wont we developing this further.
The spectrogram conversion + putting tracks through the model, result in very artifacty sound (especially with a limited resources we have to train it).

Next up we are looking at other ways to restore lost sounds.
