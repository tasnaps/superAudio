Audio Enhancement Tool (WIP)
Overview

Trial of using U-net to try to restore high and low frequencies of music tracks. The outcome was something truly horrible and I wont we developing this further.
The spectrogram conversion + putting tracks through the model, result in very artifacty sound (especially with a limited resources we have to train it).

Although the resutls weren't good, this repository contains plenty of nice utility functions - such as audio conversions, frequency cutters, U-net pipeline.
