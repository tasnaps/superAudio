Todo:

Training loop (basic training loop done, with necessary steps for backpropagation and weight updating):
load batch of spectograms of the lofi and hifi
Forward propagate low quality spectograms through the U-net model
Calculate the loss between models output and hifi spectrograms
Backpropagate loss and update model weights
Evaluate model on set of validation data to monitor it's performance and prevent overfitting.

Model evaluation and iteration
UseSNR or PESQ, and listen to audio samples of enhanced audio to see if improved or not...
