Todo:
Spectogram conversion for audio files in storage folder.
Model input and output formatting: resize spectograms to one size, normalize spectogram values, convert spectograms into pytorch tensors and splite into training and validation sets

Training setup:
Batch size: Choose batch size
Optimizer and loss function: ...MSE?
Learning rate: Recommended at 1e-3 or 1e-4

Training loop:
load batch of spectograms of the lofi and hifi
Forward propagate low quality spectograms through the U-net model
Calculate the loss between models output and hifi spectrograms
Backpropagate loss and update model weights
Evaluate model on set of validation data to monitor it's performance and prevent overfitting.

Model evaluation and iteration
UseSNR or PESQ, and listen to audio samples of enhanced audio to see if improved or not...
